# LocalSubtitle
kodi addon to add a local subtitle to a video

This addon is a kodi subtitle addon to apply a local subtitle to the current playing video.
Kodi has its own possibility to load a local subtitle (via Browse for subtitle...) but that sometimes does not work (hanging) and that is why this addon was created.
This addon is opened via Download subtitle
The location of the subtitle must be defined in kodi, Settings, Player, Language, Custom subtitle folder. On Raspberry Pi, a possible place is /storage/videos because that is a share that can be accessed by any computer in the network but any folder accessable by kodi will do.
The name of the subtitle is fixed and always subtitle.srt

The addon can be downloaded from https://github.com/peno64/LocalSubtitle/releases

To install, put the zip file somewhere where kodi can access it. Then in kodi, choose Install from zip file, navigate to the zip and choose it.
